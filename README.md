# Capture The Flag

Capture the flag solutions and write-ups. 

DO NOT cheat and submit other people's solutions.

The main focus here is on learning reverse engineering and binary exploits.
 
Included are notes and tools, each folder should have documentation describing the included challenges.

There are many uncompleted and unfinished challenges. Some of them will probably stay unsolved.
