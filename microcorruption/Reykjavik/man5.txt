______________________________________________________________________


OVERVIEW

    - Lockitall developers  have implemented  military-grade on-device
      encryption to keep the password secure.
    - This lock is not attached to any hardware security module.


DETAILS

    The LockIT Pro a.03  is the first of a new series  of locks. It is
    controlled by a  MSP430 microcontroller, and is  the most advanced
    MCU-controlled lock available on the  market. The MSP430 is a very
    low-power device which allows the LockIT  Pro to run in almost any
    environment.

    The  LockIT  Pro   contains  a  Bluetooth  chip   allowing  it  to
    communiciate with the  LockIT Pro App, allowing the  LockIT Pro to
    be inaccessable from the exterior of the building.

    There is  no default password  on the LockIT  Pro---upon receiving
    the LockIT Pro, a new password must be set by connecting it to the
    LockIT Pro  App and  entering a password  when prompted,  and then
    restarting the LockIT Pro using the red button on the back.

    This is Hardware  Version A.  It contains  the Bluetooth connector
    built in, and one available port  to which the LockIT Pro Deadbolt
    should be connected.

    This is Software Revision 02. This release contains military-grade
    encryption so users can be confident that the passwords they enter
    can not be read from memory.   We apologize for making it too easy
    for the password to be recovered on prior versions.  The engineers
    responsible have been sacked.
