flag{b0ffer_0verf10w_3asy_as_123}

----------------------------------------

long code = 0;
char name[16];

...

gets(name);

if(code != 0) {
  system("/bin/sh");
}

----------------------------------------

basically this has a char array of size 16
after the array in memory is a long
you need to overflow the array into the long
just need to change value doesnt matter what it is
this happens since gets does not check size when writing
the long is initially set to 0
after change value through overflow will pass check in the if
this will call bin/sh on the server
then cat flag.txt

need 24 bytes to get to where the location of the long is in memory
the 25th byte will start changing the value
